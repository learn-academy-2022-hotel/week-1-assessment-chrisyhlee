# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is what is on your computer right in front of you. The difference between git and GitHub is that git can only be changed or updated by someone with physical access to the git, while GitHub is a platform that allows any person from anywhere to have access and push/pull to and from as needed.

Researched answer: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Conditionals will return Boolean values.

Researched answer: Equality, Relational, and Logical operators will return Boolean values.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the current assigned position of a character within a string or array. The difference between index and value is that index indication position while value indicates what the character is representing.

Researched answer: The index property is a read-only property. It contains the position of a regular expression match within a string. Values are chunks that represent pieces of information.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: An array is a list of data types separated individually within a container. A string is a data type. An array can contain a string. When counting the length of an array, it counts each data type separated by a comma as 1, while in a string, each character within the string counts as a length. Similarly, in an array, each data type holds its own index, while each character in a string holds its own index.

Researched answer: Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair programming is 2 people working together on the same project to reach the same goal. There is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person with hands-on the computer physically creating the code. The navigator is responsible for giving the driver the direction and instruction they need to get to their shared end-goal destination.

Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. While one acts as a driver (writing code), the other will play a navigator's role (ensuring the accuracy of the code).

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a type of function that takes one or more function(s) as arguments and/or returns a functions as a result.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework used to make sure your code in JavaScript is correct.

3. Objects: An object is its own entity that has its own properties that define it.

4. Method: Methods are actions that are able to be performed on objects in JavaScript.

5. Classes: In JavaScript, classes are templates used in order to create objects from. Classes contain data with code to work on the data it contains.
